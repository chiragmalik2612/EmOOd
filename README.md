# EmOOd
It's a website where you can record your Moods & Emotions time to time and have a history of all the moods. It may help you in analyzing yourself. Also, Sometimes we find difficulty in identifying and expressing what we feel (this is called Alexithymia), this platform will give you options so that you can relate.

## my learnings
* i started learning and implementing firebase paralley with this project.
* used chart.js for the very first time

## Bug

## Features to add
* email verification
* forget password
* showing history according to user
* add a note when logging any mood so that user can have record why they were feeling like this.
* and some more features for better purpose.

## Use of this project
It's basically giving a space to user where he/she can keep record of their moods & emotions time to time. I think it's an important thing that can help user to analyze himself/herself.
Also many people find difficulty in explaining and realizing what they are exactly feeling, this platform give many options and their description so that user can understand and relate.
and I'll try to add many other features that will make this platform more useful to the users.
